# User Profiles & Authentication - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This implementation extends the ScaleUp Community platform with comprehensive user profile management and privacy controls. Users can now manage detailed academic and personal information with granular privacy settings.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Profile Fields

**Academic Information:**
- `major`: Academic field of study (e.g., "Computer Science Engineering")
- `year`: Expected graduation year (e.g., "2025")
- `courses`: Array of enrolled courses (e.g., ["CS101", "MA101", "PH101"])

**Personal Information:**
- `bio`: Personal description/biography text
- `interests`: Array of interests (e.g., ["Machine Learning", "Web Development"])
- `clubs`: Array of club memberships (e.g., ["Coding Club", "Tech Society"])

**Existing Fields Enhanced:**
- `impact`: Gamification points (unchanged)
- `badges`: Achievement badges (unchanged)

### 2. Privacy Settings System

Granular control over profile visibility with the following toggles:

```javascript
privacySettings: {
  profileVisibility: 'public',     // 'public', 'friends', 'private'
  showMajor: true,                 // Show/hide academic major
  showYear: true,                  // Show/hide graduation year
  showInterests: true,             // Show/hide interests list
  showClubs: true,                 // Show/hide club memberships
  showCourses: false,              // Show/hide course list (default: hidden)
  showBio: true,                   // Show/hide personal bio
  showImpactPoints: true           // Show/hide gamification points
}
```

### 3. Profile Management UI

**View Mode:**
- Displays all profile information respecting privacy settings
- Clean, card-based layout with emojis for visual appeal
- Quick access to edit profile and privacy settings

**Edit Mode:**
- Form-based editing for all profile fields
- Comma-separated input for arrays (interests, clubs, courses)
- Multi-line text area for biography
- Form validation and error handling

**Privacy Settings Mode:**
- Toggle switches for each privacy setting
- Visual feedback (✅/❌) for enabled/disabled settings
- Immediate preview of privacy changes

### 4. API Integration

New API methods added to `mockDB.js`:

```javascript
// Update user profile data
api.updateUserProfile({ userId, profileData })

// Update privacy settings
api.updatePrivacySettings({ userId, privacySettings })
```

## File Changes Made

### 1. `/src/state/mockDB.js`
- Enhanced user model with new profile fields
- Added default privacy settings
- Implemented profile update API methods
- Added notification generation for profile updates

### 2. `/src/screens/ProfileScreen.js`
- Complete rewrite with state management for editing
- Three-mode interface: View, Edit, Privacy Settings
- Form handling with validation
- Privacy-aware data display

### 3. `/App.js`
- Updated to use actual screen components instead of DummyScreen
- Proper imports for all three main screens

### 4. `/supabase_schema.sql` (NEW)
- Complete database schema for Supabase deployment
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper indexing for performance
- Trigger functions for business logic
- Sample data for testing

## Database Schema (Supabase)

### Core Tables

**users**
- Enhanced with all profile fields
- JSONB privacy settings for flexibility
- Proper constraints and defaults

**communities, posts, notifications**
- Existing functionality maintained
- Enhanced with proper foreign key relationships

### Security Features

**Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Profile visibility respects privacy settings
- Users can only edit their own data
- Public data remains accessible

**Triggers and Functions**
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Impact point calculations
- Notification generation

## Usage Examples

### Updating Profile
```javascript
const profileData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  major: "Computer Science Engineering",
  year: "2025",
  bio: "Passionate about AI and machine learning",
  interests: ["Machine Learning", "Web Development"],
  clubs: ["AI Club", "Coding Club"],
  courses: ["CS101", "CS201", "MA101"]
};

await api.updateUserProfile({ userId: user.id, profileData });
```

### Updating Privacy Settings
```javascript
const privacySettings = {
  showMajor: true,
  showYear: true,
  showInterests: true,
  showClubs: false,
  showCourses: false,
  showBio: true,
  showImpactPoints: true
};

await api.updatePrivacySettings({ userId: user.id, privacySettings });
```

## Testing

The implementation has been validated with:
- ✅ Syntax validation for all JavaScript files
- ✅ Data structure validation tests
- ✅ Schema compatibility testing
- ✅ Privacy settings logic verification

## Installation & Migration

### For Development (using mockDB)
1. The enhanced profile system is ready to use immediately
2. No additional setup required - all data is stored in memory

### For Production (using Supabase)
1. Run the provided SQL schema: `supabase_schema.sql`
2. Update API calls to use Supabase client instead of mockDB
3. Configure authentication with Supabase Auth
4. Test RLS policies with different user roles

## Future Enhancements

**Potential additions:**
- Profile photo upload
- Social connections (friends/followers)
- Advanced privacy levels (friends-only, course-mates-only)
- Profile completion progress indicators
- Export profile data functionality

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Validation**: All profile inputs should be sanitized
2. **Privacy Enforcement**: Backend must respect privacy settings
3. **Access Control**: Proper RLS implementation in production
4. **Data Backup**: Regular backups of user profile data
5. **GDPR Compliance**: User data deletion and export capabilities

This implementation provides a robust foundation for user profile management while maintaining the existing community features and ensuring user privacy control.
