## Privacy System

### Privacy Levels
1. **Public**: Visible to everyone
2. **Community Members**: Visible to users in common communities
3. **Friends**: Visible to connected users
4. **Private**: Only visible to the user

### Privacy Filtering
The system uses a database function `get_user_profile_with_privacy` that:
- Takes target user ID and requesting user ID
- Returns filtered profile based on privacy settings and relationship
- Handles all privacy logic at the database level for security

### Default Privacy Settings
- **Public by default**: Name, email, major, graduation year, interests, etc.
- **Private by default**: Phone number, timezone
- **Configurable**: All settings can be changed by the user

## Profile Completion System

### Completion Calculation
- Tracks completion percentage based on filled fields
- Updates automatically when profile is modified
- Provides suggestions for fields to complete

### Completion Suggestions
- Identifies empty or incomplete fields
- Provides actionable suggestions
- Links directly to profile editing

## Integration with Existing System

### Maintained Features
- **Impact Points**: Existing impact system preserved
- **Badges**: Original badge system maintained
- **Community System**: Full integration with existing communities
- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth system

### Enhanced Features
- **Better User Discovery**: Search and filter users
- **Privacy-Aware**: Respects user privacy preferences
- **Rich Profiles**: More detailed user information
- **Achievement System**: Extended beyond basic badges

## Usage Examples

### Updating Profile
```javascript
await api.updateUserProfile({
  major: 'Computer Science',
  graduation_year: 2024,
  interests: ['Programming', 'AI', 'Web Development'],
  biography: 'Passionate about technology and innovation'
});
```

### Updating Privacy Settings
```javascript
await api.updatePrivacySettings({
  phone_number: 'private',
  location: 'community_members',
  interests: 'public'
});
```

### Getting User Profile with Privacy
```javascript
const profile = await api.getUserProfile(userId, requestingUserId);
// Returns filtered profile based on privacy settings
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Database-Level Privacy**: Privacy filtering happens at the database level
2. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies protect user data
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before storage
4. **Privacy Validation**: Privacy settings are validated before application

## Future Enhancements

1. **Profile Templates**: Pre-defined profile templates for different user types
2. **Advanced Search**: More sophisticated search and filtering options
3. **Profile Analytics**: Insights into profile views and interactions
4. **Social Features**: Enhanced social connections and networking
5. **Profile Verification**: Verification system for academic credentials
